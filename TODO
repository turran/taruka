+ Make the editor work by plugins
+ Each plugin must register a new mimetype + name
+ The editor on the New... option, must select from a set of mime types, SVG, EON, etc, etc
+ Such mimetype registered, document for say something, is fetchable by other plugins, i.e add dependable plugins
+ With such document, register value types for the property editor, define how it should be created. i.e register
  mutation events on the element in order to refresh the values
+ Register ways of modifying the text editor too
+ Tools ideas:
  1. Drawer + playback
  2. Property editor
  3. Text editor of the XML itself
  4. Script console + debug
  5. Mounted filesystem
  6. A console to printf dom errors, eina_logs, etc
